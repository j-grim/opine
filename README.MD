About Opine
=======================

Opine is a bit of a learning project, both for the creator, and in that it is quite literally a learning program. 

The goal with Opine is to passively "learn" about public opinion, in both specific contexts and broad ones. The application of such a project is infinite, but my test target is "propaganda detection" within the mainstream media, and to ask whether or not public media uses suggestibility or the misrepresentation of popular opinion to pressure the public into adopting certain attitudes. 

The inspiration for this target is, of course the failure of the mainstream media to accurately portray or predict the 2016 election statistics and outcomes.
